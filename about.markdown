Wunki is written by me, Petar Radošević, a '82 born Croatian living in the Netherlands. If a persons reflection can be shown by the things they enjoy doing in live, mine would be programming, reading books, playing basketball & soccer and watching a movie with my girl. Finally, added more recently, riding my bike. 

Another part of my life evolves around [Bread and Pepper]. A company [Wouter], [Joeri] and I started in 2009. We focus on developing web applications that are spicy on the backend, but simple on the frontend; hence the name and [logo]. My role within this ecosystem is maintaining the servers and programming in Python using [Django], [Tornado] or [Flask] framework.

## Open source projects

Most of the tools I use are open sourced. I love the open culture of software development, so I try to do my part and give back to this awesome community.
You can find my open-sourced software on [my Github page]. Some of the things you will find there are a account management application for [Django] and my [dotfiles] setup for the software below.

## My setup

I develop on my Macbook Pro (2011) which has 8GB of ram and a SSD harddisk (must-have). I keep my servers running on FreeBSD. My periphials are a non-printed, black [HHKB II Proff.] keyboard. and [Sennheiser HD 380 Pro] headphone. I don't want to work without those anymore. My keyboard layout is [Programmer Dvorak].

### Software

My current editor is [Vim], terminal of choice is the new [iTerm2] terminal. [1Password] that generates a random password for every service that I use. [Chrome] and [Safari] for browsing the web and [org-mode] that manages my todo's and agenda. For music I rely on the excellent library of [Spotify].
