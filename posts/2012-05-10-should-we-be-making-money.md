Two weeks ago we released our little iPhone app called [Invy]. It's solves the
problem of scheduling a meetup with your friends, family or whoever. It's been
a rollercoaster since then, reviews are great and we got a fair amount of
press coverage. 

<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function(){
  var plot2 = $.jqplot ('chart1', [[3,7,9,1,4,6,8,2,5]], {
      title: 'Invy sales',
      axesDefaults: {
        labelRenderer: $.jqplot.CanvasAxisLabelRenderer
      },
      axes: {
        xaxis: {
          label: "Day",
          pad: 0
        },
        yaxis: {
          label: "Sales"
        }
      }
    });
});
</script>
<div id="chart1" style="height:300px; width:94%; margin:10px;"></div>
