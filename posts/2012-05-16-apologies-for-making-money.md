When building [Invy] with [Bread & Pepper] we had lengthy debates on how a
button should behave. Deciding how to monetize it required no such
thing. Since we all hated ads -- and making money from ads is getting harder
thanks to ad-cataract[^1] -- we were left with one option, charging money for
it. It seemed obvious at the time, that when you supply something of value,
you receive a compensation for the supplied value. We estimated the value for
Invy at $1.99. However, after launching [Invy], several people found this to be
wrong, they told us it should be "gratis" instead.

You can not argue that the adoption rate would be higher if [Invy] would be
free. The real question is, does it increase the value of [Invy]. Let me try
to explain why I believe this is not the case.

## Paying for Bread

When we get the question why we ask money for [Invy] we answer jokingly, but
as often with humor containing a core of truth: "We need money to buy
bread". You would think that it's obvious to ask money for Apps, but
developers are shooting their own foot by conditioning people to believe most
Apps should be free. Something we, developers, endorse by creating Apps which
ignore revenue:

> hopefully weâ€™ll never have to go down that road."
> -- <cite>[Gifture on TheNextWeb]</cite>

The above confused me when I read it for the first time because it seems to
ignore the ground rule for a business: _generating revenue_. I quickly
understood that they also went with the revenue model where the _user is the
currency_. The [sale of Instagram] to Facebook for $1.000.000.000,- (one
billion) made it an even stronger incentive to pick this model.

However, because the priority is given to amassing users, there is a
deliberate choice to ignore revenue which could be made by payments or ads
because of its negative impact on the adoption rate. As more businesses choose
this approach, it's causing the consumer to form a connection between
_social_, _free_ and _ad-less_ as first shown by [Twitter]. A bleed over effect
to Apps in general will only strengthen the consumers belief that Apps are
free.

At the other end of the spectrum are the developers which use this "business"
model because it has shown to lead to an valuation of 100 billion (Facebook)
or a sale for one billion (Instagram). The irony is that a sale -- counting as
a success for the seller -- is often a disappointment for the user because of
the discontinuation of the service. The consumers demand of free software and
developers neglect of revenue creates a self-reinforcing effect which benefits
neither.

## Revenue has it's Perks

[Invy] has just sold it's 4000Th copy on the App store, something we would
have achieved earlier if we made the App free. However, we still stand by our
choice to ask money. Out of necessity because we are bootstrapping and are
living of our savings and out of practicality because it increases the
quality of our product.

A benefit of this model is the higher quality of feedback because users are
invested in the product and they want value for their money. The feedback
let's us improve the application and results in more units sold. The generated
revenue also keeps the service running while maintaining a natural growth. The
benefit for our users is that we don't need to look for an investment or
payout and can keep the service running as long as it's value stays proven.

Consumer and developer would benefit when Apps don't neglect revenue and lure
in users by presenting an unsustainable utopia made by bits. It's not only bad
for your product, but every outcome results in a disappointment for your
users. Now, spend some money on [our App], it only costs $1.99.

our brain to ignore ads.
