![Headphones, Coding, Happy.](/images/writing-code.png)

Wunki is written by Petar Radošević, a '82 born Croatian living in the Netherlands. If a persons reflection can be shown by the things they enjoy doing in live, mine would be programming, reading books, running and watching a movie with my girl.

Another part of my life evolves around [Bread and Pepper]. A company [Wouter], [Joeri] and I started in 2009. We focus on developing software which is spicy on the backend, but simple on the frontend.

## Sofware

Most of the tools I use are open source and I love the open culture of software development. Take a look at my [Github page] to find [django-userena], an account management application for [Django], my [dotfiles] and some random bytes.

My current editor is [Vim], terminal of choice is the new [iTerm2] terminal. [1Password] that generates a random password for every service that I use. [Safari] for browsing the web and [Things] to manage my tasks. Most of the day I'm listening to [Di.fm] or [Somafm] radio.

## Peripherals

I develop on my Macbook Pro (2011) with enough RAM and a SSD harddisk (must-have). I keep my servers running on FreeBSD. My periphials are a non-printed, black [HHKB II Proff.] keyboard -- used for typing in Dvorak] -- and [Sennheiser HD 380 Pro] headphone.
